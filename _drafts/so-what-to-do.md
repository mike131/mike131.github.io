## Why am I making this blog ?
So before I start, a bit of backstory...

I have been a web developer for about 3 years now and currently working at a tech startup but living in the Bay Area. The current goals in my life are to get better at what I do and hopefully get a gig at a larger tech company.

Currently I am starting to practice and prepare for interviews, which is a bit nerve-racking. The constant thoughts of "Am I good enough?", "Do I have the best solution?", "Am I a good programmer?" are in the back of my mind, but I know that I need to push through and believe in in myself and my ability to prepare.

My roommate and I have setup a whiteboard decal wall, which of course was purchsed through <a href="http://amzn.to/1Lb8gpF" target="_blank">Amazon</a> and a set of dry erase markers to stick to the wall next to it.
